I conducted a semi-structured interview with six professors and administrators of the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. The aim of the interviews was to evaluate the first ideas for an app and to figure out the needs and the requirements of a university app for managers. Participants of the interview were asked to sort the university departments by communication frequency to gain insights into  existing problems and challenges. This work included planning, conducting, transcribing, evaluating the interviews and presenting the results and further recommendations.
