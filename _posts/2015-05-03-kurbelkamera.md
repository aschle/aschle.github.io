This project is part of the CodingDaVinci Kultur-Hackathon 2015. It is a collaboration between Freie Universität Berlin and Kunsthochschule Weißensee as part of a software project in the summer semester 2015. In a team of four students (Fanny, Lukas, Katjuscha and me) we developed an interactive exhibit, which aims at young people visiting museums. The exhibit should enable people to understand the old technology to play and record a film in a fun way. Very intensive user testing led to a successful installation and we were able to win a prize at the hackathon in the category "most technical".
