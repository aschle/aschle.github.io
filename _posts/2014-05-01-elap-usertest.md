With the help of the Entrepreneurship Learning and Exchange Platform (ELAP) teachers can design courses, manage teaching materials from the field of entrepreneurship and exchange them with colleagues.

We conducted a heuristic evaluation, using the results of that I prepared low fidelity prototype for the ELAP landing page and for the search and filter interface. Both paper prototypes were evaluated in a user study with four participants.
