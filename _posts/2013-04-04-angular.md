We developed a web interface for ordering and paying in a pub. It is possible to search for beverages, favor drinks and place orders.
The interface is multilingual (i18n). The ordering is done by drag and drop. Drag and drop is part of the HTML5 standard and is available completely in chrome and firefox. A draggable element (source) can be dragged with the mouse to a droppable element (target). We also implemented Undo and redo using the command pattern.
