With the help of the Entrepreneurship Learning and Exchange Platform (ELAP) teachers can design courses, manage teaching materials from the field of entrepreneurship and exchange them with colleagues. Using a heuristic evaluation, we aimed to improve the platform in terms of usability. I was responsible for project management and the project execution in general. The results of the evaluation were discussed in a workshop with the ELAP members. I have developed guidelines and best practices on the subject how to design form fields. For uploading the teaching material to the platform I created the first mockup using best practices.
