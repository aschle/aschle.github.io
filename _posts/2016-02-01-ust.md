In order to improve the general appearance and signage of a windsurfing school and to make it more intuitive and appealing for visitors, I developed wooden signs using the corporate design.
It has helped to make the windsurfing school more usable for customers and as well as employees. A total of 30 signs were designed, built and hung.
