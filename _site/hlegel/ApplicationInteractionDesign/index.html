				This hand-crafted "CV", was part of my course Design Thinking. It was part of the initial T-Profile challenge. I intended to show that I enjoy hand-crafting and using different materials and styles.</p>
				<p>The collage is maid mainly from different kinds of paper, printed cotton and several layers of cardboard. The purpose of using layers of cardboard was to create an the impression of three-dimensionality and to make parts moveable. There are parts which can be slided, switched and rotated. The elements are placed on different levels to make them stand out and to make the collage interactive. An old typewriter was used to produce the special font.</p>
				<p>I chose this artwork because the overall concept has a very good effect despite combining different techniques, styles, fonts and colours. I love to craft using my hands and to present ideas in a different way not only using the computer and Photoshop.</p>
				<p>The aim of the collage is to show what my interests are and what I enjoy besides studying computer science. The most challenging task was getting the moving parts moveable, as it required a lot of planning ahead and precise cutting of elements.</p>

				<p>As part of my bachelor project I implemented an web based prototype for annotating text with different categories (e.g. Architecture, History, etc.). The project focused on visualising annotations which are annotated more than once. Those are called overlapping annotations. The phrase "Malmö University" is annotated with "educational institution". Additionally "Malmö" is annotated with "city in Sweden". The research question was how to visualize to the user what is already annotated and in which category. Using an iterative approach I developed two design ideas (which can be seen in figure 2 and 3), which were evaluated through a user study. The results were used to redefine and improve the developed concepts. I continued working on that project after my bachelor project was finished in order to find a better solution which is shown in figure 4.</p>
				<p>Picking that work I wanted to emphasize that I am a passionate programmer, very engaged and interested in usability topics and user studies to develop a better tool. While using user testing and interviewing people I discovered so much new and valuable information. That is why I really enjoyed by bachelor project.</p>

		<!-- DESIGN ASSIGNMENT: 4-WEEK-PLAN -->
		<h2 class="section" id="design-assignment">4-WEEK-PLAN<small>design assignment</small></h2>
		<div class="row clearfix">
			<div class="eight columns offset-by-four">
				<p>The outcome of the four week project should be an design proposal for the online magazine, focusing in the Open Corner section. The timeframe of the project is 20 days with four interdisciplinary students working fulltime on the project. The customer is Anna who is going to be the editor-in-chief.</p>
				<h3>Teamwork, Communication and Methods</h3>
				<p>As an overall design process, we will be using elements from the design thinking process. The initial challenge could be:</p>
				<blockquote>Design the Open Corner section of an influential and collaborative online magazine focusing on the Swedish welfare system, which connects and fosters communication between social activists, social sector professionals and the general public in an creative, innovative and modern way.</blockquote>
				<h4>First things first: Creating a Team</h4>
				<p>The very first step is to create a good atmosphere for teamwork, beginning with introducing each other. The group should identify and talk about strength and weaknesses of all members, also about preferences, skills and (personal) goals. If needed roles should be defined within the team and rules could be agreed on.</p>
				<h4>Communication and Documentation</h4>
				<p>All members of the team will be exchanging phone numbers and email addresses right at the first day, so everybody is available. The group should meet at university on a daily basis at a certain time. A check in and check out procedure is an essential part of the daily routines. Also the teamwork should be reflected on a regular basis. Daily team meetings should be an integral part of the project, so everybody is up-to-date concerning project deadlines, appointment and progress.</p>
				<p>For each day, the team needs to agree on a schedule, for structuring the day to ensure working in an efficient way. The important achievements etc. should be documented each day (pictures, sketches, interviews, decisions, videos etc.) so that everybody is able to catch up, if he/she missed something. Writing things down and documenting is also a good way to agree on decisions, keeping everyone at the same level and avoiding misunderstandings within the team. Ideally an online platform or wiki or blog should be used to collect the data. By that all team members can access everything at any time and will not waste time, while searching for things. The wiki or blog is also a good tool for including Anna in the process, also for informing other stakeholders and to keep them involved.</p>
				<h4>Communication with Anna</h4>
				<p>Anna is included in the design process on a regular basis by having regular presentations and meetings about the progress. To get feedback from her as early as possible is important to validate ideas and the direction the team is heading. She is the one who is getting the design proposal in the end and needs to be satisfied.</p>
				<h3>Time Schedule</h3>
				<p>The time schedule consists of 20 days, aiming to deliver a finished design proposal, which is meeting all needs of the stakeholders. Time for developing and writing the final proposal needs to be reserved. Regular meetings with Anna, e.g. a regular presentation day each week needs to be included in the 4-week-plan. In the beginning time should be reserved for getting to know each other and having a "Kick-Off-Meeting" with Anna. For getting the team in action and curious about the project one day is scheduled for a "Fast Forward". That means doing all design thinking steps in one day resulting in a draft prototype for the design proposal.</p>
				<p>In general, the rest of the time should be split up between the design thinking steps: Understand, Observe, Define, Ideate, Prototype. In the end there should be also enough time for iteration.</p>
				<h4>Understand and Observe</h4>
				<p>The most important thing is understanding the challenge. What is our target group? Who are the stakeholders? Who do we want to attract? What is Anna aiming for? Are there analogue or related projects? The magazine is supposed to be read only online. How does this affect our target group? Who are the people, who are reading online magazines? What other magazines are they reading?</p>
				<p>As the topic of the magazine will be the Swedish welfare system the team needs to find out about that system. In what kind of topics are potential readers interested? What kind of collaboration and information exchange is needed and wanted by the users?</p>
				<p>The team needs to do interviews and questionnaires targeting the different stakeholder groups. Interviewing experts of the social sector, like professors and governmental people should also be done. Talking to social activists (e.g. Anna) is also needed. The biggest stakeholder group, the general public, needs to be interviewed as well. In the end, for each user group a persona is created. After the research is completed the team can be confident about the different needs, goals and perspectives of each stakeholder group. The most important thing is to meet as much user needs as possible and also identifying conflict within needs and perspectives, so the design proposal will be based on a profound motivation.</p>
				<p>Finding out about scenarios for collaboration and information sharing is very important to design the Open Corner. What is important for the different groups regarding collaboration? What is the aim of collaboration? What do they want to achieve? What kind of information do they want to share? How do other collaboration platforms work? What devices are used when participating in the Open Corner section? What are the use cases? How do potential users find out about the new online magazine?</p>
				<h4>Define</h4>
				<p>Now the team needs to agree on the problem they want to target and what they are focusing on. What are the insight they found out about? What the Point of View?</p>
				<h4>Ideate, Prototype and Test</h4>
				<p>Using all the information and facts the team learned during the research phase, they are now generating ideas using brainstorming methods. It is important to build prototypes at early stages and using those to test key features with future users and stakeholders to get constructive and useful feedback.</p>
				<h4>Final Presentation</h4>
				<p>All people who participated in the project are invited to a presentation about the final design proposal.</p>

				<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
				<p>The most important reason for applying for the Interaction Design Programme is the fact that using a human-centred design process to achieve a great, innovative and convincing product or service is the most satisfying way of working for me.</p>

				<p>During a course about "Design Thinking", which I attended last spring, I realised that I want to focus even more on humanistic approaches and design in general. During my studies of computer science we focused on the technology part of developing a tool or software. Usability needs and design aspects were treated as rather unnecessary. Design thinking taught me to base decisions on broad research and an analytical phase. That way of working is also reflected in the courses Malmö University offers and therefore coincides with the way I want to work.</p>

				<p>During my previous studies I attended courses at Berlin University of Arts in the field of "Art and Media". I gained knowledge related to screen design (typography, photography, 3D animation, layout, etc.) and analytical drawing, which focused on observing real world objects and drawing them. Therefore I feel confident in understanding and handling design related problems.</p>

				<p>More knowledge in interaction design would complement my prior studies in computer science. I think it is a great way to design and develop software and services with the help of profound interaction design knowledge. During my bachelor thesis I used an iterative process to develop a tool for annotating text with categories, focusing on the visualization of overlapping annotations. Doing user testing and interviewing people at an very early stage really helped me achieving great results. My bachelor thesis made me realize that usability and interaction design are the topics I am enthusiastic about and want to focus on in the future</p>

				<p>Sweden is known for its very good educational system as well as for providing the basis for innovation. Sweden is second of the Global Innovation Index. I noticed heigh technological standards and an acceptance towards electronic systems during my several visits in Sweden that I found very surprising and different to what can be experienced in Germany. It would be a pleasure for me to live and study in such a creative and exciting environment.</p>

				<p>I intend to gain more knowledge and relevant skills to be prepared for working professionally as an interaction designer. Combining the knowledge I acquired during my computer science studies with what I learn at Malmö University will definitely accelerate my professional career and help me to achieve what I am aiming at.</p>
