To whom it may concern,

The most important reason for applying to the Interaction Design Programme is the fact that working together with people to really achieve a great, innovative and satisfying product or service is the most important thing for me. Following a human-centred design process is almost all cases the way to go.

During a course about "Design Thinking", which I attended last spring, I realised that I wanted to focus even more on humanistic approaches and design in general. During my studies of computer science we focused on the technology part of developing a tool or software, but only looked at usability needs and design aspects as is were waste of time and not essetial.

As I learnd with the help of design thinking, starting with a broad and extend research and analytical phase, to base decisions on, is a way of working, which I really enjoy. That way of working is also reflected in the coureses Malmö University offers and coincides with the way I want to work. Having the possiblilty to attend a lot of practical classes underlines the way I learn and develop the most. During my previous studies I attended courses at Berlin University of Arts in the field of "Art and Media". I gained knowledge related to screen design and analytical drawing, which makes me confident in mastering and understanding design related problems. 

More knowledge in interaction design would very good complement my prior studies in computer science. I think it is a great way to design and develope software and services with the help of profound interaction design knowledge. One feature of the courses really catched my attention: "multidisciplinary teams". I am an very open-minden person, who loves and needs the constant social and cultural exchange to learn and develop new skills. Having lived abroad and at the moment living in a very international an vivid city I can contribute to the multicultural team.

Sweden is known for its very good educational system as well as for providing prerequirepemnts for innovation, Sweden is second of the Global Innovation Index. The very heigh technological standards and acceptence towards electronical systems, I noticed during my several visits in Sweden, were very surprisiong and at the same time verry diffent to what can be experianced in Germany. It would be a pleasure for me to live and study in such an innovative and creative environment.

I hope to gain more knowledge and relevant skills to be prepared for working in the real world as an interaction designer using my creativity and passion. Combining computer science knowledge with what I learn at Malmö University will definitely excellerate my professional career and help me do what I am dreaming of.
