DELIVERY IN THE END
The outcome of the four week project should be an design proposal for the online magazine, focusing in the Open Corner section.

TIME and PEOPLE
The timeframe of the project is 20 days. Four interdisciplinary student working fulltime on that project. 
Our custome is Anna.

TOPIC AND INITIAL REQUIREMENTS
A monthly published online magazine focusing on current topics related to the swedish welfare system should be an influtental platform where social activist, social sector professionals and the general public could connect. The main focus is the open corner section, which should support interaction, fosters the collaboration and information sharing between the three groups mentioned before. In addition the platform should be innovative and should use creative ways to share information.

METHODS AND GROUP WORK
As an overall design process, we will be using elements from the Design Thinking Process.

The challenge could be:

Design the open corner section of an influental and collaborative online magazine, which connects social activists, social sector professionals and the general puplic in an creative, innovative and modern way.

* getting to know each other
The first step should be creating a good athmosphere for teamwork, beginning with getting to know each other, as the group will be working together for four weeks. The group should identify and talk about strenght and weaknesses of all members, also about preferences and skills and goals. If needed roles should be defined or something like teamrules could be agreed on.

* communication and documentation
All members of the team will be exchanging phone numbers and email adresses right at the first day, so everybody is available. The groups should meet at university on a daily basis at a certain time. A check in and out should be included in the daily plan if possible. Also the group work should be reflected on a regular basis. Regular/daily team meetings should be an integral part of the project, to have everybody up-to-date.

For each day, the team needs to agree on a schedlue, for stucturing the day and time to work  in an efficiant way. Also the important things should be documented each day (pictures, sketches, interviews, decisions, and so on) so that everybody is able to catch up if he missed something. Writing things down and documenting is also a good way to agree on decisions, keeping every one at the same level and avoiding missunderstandings within the team. Ideally an online platform or wiki/blog should be used to collect all the data. So all team members can acess everything at anytime and don't need to waste time, while searching for stuff. The online platform is also a goot tool for including Anna in the process, also for informing other stakeholders and to keep them up-to-date.

* talking to the customer
Anna is included in the design process on a regular basis, having regular presentations and meetings about the progress and to get feedback about ideas and the direction the team is heading as early as possible. She is the one who is getting the design proposal in the end and needs to be satisfied.

TIME SCHEDULE
The timeshedule consists of 20 days, aiming to deliver a finished design proposal (documemtation and prototype). So also time for developing and writing the final proposal needs to be reserved. Regular meeting with Anna, e.g. a presentation day need to be included in the 4-week-plan. In the beginning time should be reserved for getting to know each other and getting input from Anna ("Kick off meeting" with anna). For getting the team in action one day is reserved for a "Fast Forward", that means doing all steps in one day resulting in a draft prototype for the design proposal.

In general the rest of the time should be splitted between: 
Understand, Observe, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test (design thinking steps), there should be also enough time for iteration.

Understand and OBSERVE
----------------------
Undersatnding the challenge. What is our target group? What are stakeholder? Who is going to read the magazine? Who should read teh magazine? What is Anna's aim? Are there analog/related projects out there?
The magazine is supposed to be read only online? How does this affect our target group? How/Who are those users?
As the topic of the magazine will be the swedish welfare system the team need to find out about that system? In what topics are pootential reader interested in? What kind of collaboration and information exchange is needed/wanted by the users?

The group definately need to do interviews/questionairs whith the different stakeholder groups. Interviewing experts of the social sector, like professors and governmental people. Talking to social activists (like Anna) is also neede, maybe Anna could provide potential readers, friends relatives and so on as she itselfe is active in the szene. The biggest stakeholder group the general public needs to be asked as well. In the end for each user group a persona is created. So the team can be confident about the different needs, goals and perspectives of each user group.
 
Also finding out about scenarios for collaboration/information sharing is very important to design the open corner. Whats important for the different groups regarding to collaboration? Whats the aim of collaboration? What kind of information do they want to share?

DEFINE
------
Now the team need to agree on the defined problem and what they are focusing on. What are the insight they found out about? What the POV (Point of View)?

IDEATE and PROTOTYPE and TEST
-----------------------------
Using all the things the team lerned during the reseach phase, they are now generating Ideas using brainstorming and other methods. It is important to build prototypes at early stages and using those to test keyfeatures with future users and stakeholders to get feedback.

FINAL PRESENTATION
------------------
All people they worked together with are invited to a presentation about the final design proposal.
